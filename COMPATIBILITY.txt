Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
----------------

AMD graphics driver: Download the latest *beta* driver from www.amd.com.  To build an Ubuntu 12.04 package for it see
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI

Nvidia graphics driver: Again, download the latest from www.nvidia.com.

Opensource graphics drivers for AMD or Nvidia: Unlikely, sadly.

Intel: AFK requires Ivy Bridge (3rd-generation Core architecture) or better, because it needs OpenGL 4.  It ought to work, but I don't have one to test.


G++: 12.04's default G++ is 4.6 (which doesn't support C++11).  Install a more recent version via, e.g.:

 add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
 apt-get update
 apt-get install g++-4.8
 update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.8 20

Boost: 12.04's Boost doesn't support lockfree queues.  There is a PPA for this too:

 apt-add-repository ppa:boost-latest/ppa
 apt-get update
 apt-get install libboost1.54-all-dev
