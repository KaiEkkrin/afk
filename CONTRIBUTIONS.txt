Contributions to AFK
====================

You're free to play with AFK as per the terms of the GNU General Public License.  I'd love to see some patches!

Some day I may want to distribute nicely packaged binaries of AFK for a fee, along with source code; for example, if it turns into a videogame (a possibility).  In that case, I may find myself wishing to dual-license the code, or make the GPL code optionally load a differently-licensed binary, or some such.

Since I don't want to have to go around excising some contributors' work in that situation, I hope that anyone who happens to collaborate with me on this project is OK that:
 - there's a small chance the above will happen;
 - I'll do my best to have a multilateral discussion at the time;
 - any proceeds from sale would be split according to how much work has been contributed (by some metric to be decided).
