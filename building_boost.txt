You will need boost 1.55 or later, to support MSVC 2013.

Enter the boost_1_55_0 directory (or whatever later version)

 .\bootstrap

Edit user-config.jam and add the line

 using mpi ;

And then run

 .\b2 -j 8 address-model=64 threading=multi link=static

(Replace "-j 8" with whatever number suits your system)
