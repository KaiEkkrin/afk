What I may be depending on
--------------------------

a C++ compiler
OpenGL (-lGL -lGLU)
freeglut3 (-lglut)
GLEW (-lGLEW)
OpenCL (-lOpenCL)
boost: various.  (-lboost_random)
OpenSSL: not right now, but if I want to use the AES RNG, yes.  (-lcrypto)
scons to build

freeglut3 ? (-lglut)
 - glutKeyboardFunc() and glutKeyboardUpFunc() seem to be fine to handle the keyboard; I'm sure the mouse will be similar.  Is this really all I need for input?  Maybe.
 - definitely want freeglut3 rather than a generic glut so that I get glutWarpPointer()

libsdl1.2 ? (-lSDL)
 - note that the SDL sample pegs the CPU while drawing a simple blank screen.  I don't think I want to be using that :(

libfltk1.3 ?  (-lfltk -lfltk_gl)
 - this one's basic sample doesn't peg the CPU :P
 - can it handle keyup/keydown and the various mouse movements?  try porting the codecolony Transani1 and Camera1 examples to it.

glx ? (for Linux interfacing with display and input; low level)
WGL ? (for Windows !!)
