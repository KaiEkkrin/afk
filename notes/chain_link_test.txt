Chain link test 40000 iterations, 24 threads.  Simple deque/mutex chain.

   - Volatile claimable: 0 fails, 16.9 seconds
   - Locked claimable: 0 fails, 4.3 seconds

 o Lancelot (i7 4770K, Windows)
   - Volatile claimable: 0 fails, 17.0 seconds
   - Locked claimable: 0 fails, 9.0 seconds

I'm still deeply suspicious of the LockedClaimable in particular, so I'm going
to leave this to soak for a while to see whether any bugs come out, and after
that I should try implementing the obvious lock pool (rather than dynamically
created mutex objects) to see what effect it has.

Soak tests (100 loops of the above):
