The Jigsaw Map
--------------

This shouldn't be too hard:

The current jigsaw piece assignment technique is at odds with itself, incompatible with changes to the concurrency mechanism and has known (rare) bugs.  It also doesn't fill the jigsaw properly.
Replace with the JigsawMap:
 - Each Jigsaw, upon creation, tiles itself into a number of fixed-size Places and makes a *static* list of them.  (Make an algorithm that Place-splits the jigsaw by dimensions, by finding a factor near sqrt(dimension).
 - Each Place contains a single-dimensional numbering scheme that allows the assignment of pieces out of it.
 - The Place is the unit of copying to the GPU.  (Should be sufficiently large.)
 - The Place is also the unit of timestamping.
 - The Cuboids are replaced by a Place list for pushing to the GPU.  (I can merge Places on the same row.)
 - There is also a second list of free Places that can be assigned a new piece (which is swept by the flipCuboids() function.)
 - The Jigsaw is individually locked, but all operations should be quick.  (Make sure the lock doesn't get held while pushing data to the GPU, that would stall the worker threads.)
