Yeah, that's because I'm deforming single cubes to fit the shapes, and it runs out of triangles in the cube to fit.  I've actually got a local branch right now where I'm working on a fix to enable the geometry shader to generate the additional faces.  It'll be up in a week or two, I hope.\r\n\r\nBut art is never finished, only abandoned, so I figured I'd go public right now just in case :).\r\n\r\nAfter that, I should really make an effort to get it to build on Windows.  I know that half my mates can't run my ~~useless~~ wonderful project because they don't have a GNU/Linux install.\r\n\r\nThe current defaults betray the Tetris-like skeletons of the default shapes a bit much, by the way.  Try this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./build/release/afk --shape-edge-threshold 0.05\r\n```\r\n\r\nfor something less...  cuboid.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
