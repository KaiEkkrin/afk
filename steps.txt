 - basic shape with keyboard input example. OK
 - basic core of afk. OK
 - keyboard flyaround. OK
 - keyboard control of 3D object, making sure it behaves correctly.  (maybe make a simple camera-follow object...)
 - space filling grid of tetrahedra.  (how expensive?  try to make the bottom plane parallel to the xz plane...)
 - identify which tetrahedron I'm in.
 - generate only visible tetrahedra.  (maths for intersections?  progress along planes, intersect vertices with the viewing frustum?)
 - opencl example.
 - compute location of points-grid with opencl and feed back.
 - random number generator.
 - opencl random number generator.
 - randomly distributed landscape in grid.
 - tetrahedral subdivision (more subdivision == more detail).
 - tessellation example.
